Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

+---------------------------+
|    make clean install     |
+---------------------------+

Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

+---------------+
|   exec dwm    |
+---------------+

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

+----------------------------+
| DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm |
+----------------------------+

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

+------------------------------------------------------------+
|   while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"   |
|   do                                                       |
|   	sleep 1                                              |
|   done &                                                   |
|   exec dwm                                                 |
+------------------------------------------------------------+

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
